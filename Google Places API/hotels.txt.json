Disappointed that they didn't have the Nespresso machine. \n\nThe food in the hotel is bad. Period. It's oily, and so bad that I couldn't even finish it. Don't order room service guys. \n\nThe gym is great. The steam, spa, sauna and the pool are excellent. The pool is 25 metres long. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please like it."

We did a lot of research in finding the best luxury hotel in Mumbai as we wanted to relax after all the wedding hustle-bustle.  \n\nSt. Regis was the best choice undoubtedly.  We loved everything - the location, the room, the views, the rooftop bar, the breakfast, welcome drinks at check-in and our butler Caesar who made the stay so comfortable!  We were also celebrating my husband's birthday and the hotel staff arranged a special surprise cake in the room.  They also quickly arranged a cute flower decor and cake at the breakfast table when I called them 10 minutes before arriving on the breakfast floor.  How sweet!!\n\nWould love to go back here next time we are in India!"

The place is a few kilometers away from the ghat which is nice if you like some peace and quiet away from the maddening crowd and noise of the old city. The staff where extremely helpful in organizing transportation even at 2 am for my temple visit and the driver was very reliable and took care of your needs The in-house restaurant seemed very popular with the locals and residents. I did not eat much but what I tried was tasty.  \nThe staff was very helpful, the food was good ! Loved the cafe area gave a very up class vibe to the place !\nStay Banaras was very clean and comfortable, and the staff were extremely helpful. The hospitality shown by these lovely people was second to none, we were treated wonderfully, and so were able to have the experience of a lifetime in Varanasi. Thank you so much"

Since there was a lot of sound on the ground floor near the cafe, we went to the 33 floor on the building from the whole city‚Äôs view was absolutely spectacular. \n\nI did order Coffee while I was getting interviewed and the coffee tasted really good, obviously not the best. So I would definitely recommend this hotel to you guys."

The people who work there are very kind.\n\nI just had one problem that was that the hotel car who collected me at the airport the first day stopped somewhere to make me buy some stuff. It was not a bad experience but no doubts someone would not really like it. So i recommend telling the drivers to go straight to the hotel, with no stops.\n\nThank you for the hotel! It was a great stay."

Some very old fashioned key system for the lifts to the room. Room is modern and upgraded/renovated thankfully. Only has a Steam unfortunately so if your a fan like me of Sauna & Jacuzzi then tough luck. Only giving 3 star since I personally quite like modern and loaded up amenities which the hotel fell short off."

No complaints as such, but I have seen way more hospitable staff in cheaper hotels. The view is undoubtedly the best, but apart from that not worth the cost. Would suggest to stay somewhere else. The area has better 5 star hotels."
